La reine Noxe - 2018-02-02 at 1:58 PM

It is a seemingly beautiful morning in the kingdom of devRantia.


Curse-Kun - 2018-02-02 at 2:03 PM

There is a carriage heading towards the palace.


Les Oliveas - 2018-02-02 at 2:38 PM

The lake glistens in the light of the rising sun.


La reine Noxe - 2018-02-02 at 4:29 PM

Birds are chirping while the royal family is having breakfast.


Curse-Kun - 2018-02-02 at 4:51 PM

The carriage stopped at the palace gate.


Les Oliveas - 2018-02-02 at 4:58 PM

It was large, grandiose and imposing; one would not wish to be an enemy of this kingdom.


ThatDude Les Bakk - 2018-02-02 at 9:35 PM

the gate opens for the carriage


Le Electrux - 2018-02-02 at 9:42 PM

the carriage enters through the gates... horses make euphonies, entranced by the sheer richness and color of the kingdom. The passengers are left thunderstruck and keep gawking at the gorgeous sight before them


La reine Noxe - 2018-02-02 at 10:36 PM

The denizens were asking themselves who the visitors were, meanwhile the Queen was receiving information from her spy


Les Oliveas - 2018-02-02 at 10:46 PM

Faces appeared in windows to observe the new arrivals.


Curse-Kun - 2018-02-02 at 10:58 PM

That's when everyone heard that thunderous sound from the mountains.


Le Potter - 2018-02-03 at 1:24 AM

Along with a sudden and strong wind that stirred the dust up high.  The carriage stopped and the gates opened.


La reine Noxe - 2018-02-03 at 5:32 AM

Something huge was coming towards the palace - something huge and yellow, wearing a gigantic cape


romangraef89o - 2018-02-03 at 2:35 PM

But before we look into those recent activities, let's have alook at our hero.


Le Electrux - 2018-02-03 at 4:15 PM

who is as usual, late to her party! at least she could come to her own celebration on time for once


Curse-Kun - 2018-02-03 at 6:53 PM

But she is too tired to move her feet


Le Electrux - 2018-02-03 at 7:10 PM

owing to the recent victory she claimed against the 7 headed deathhound


La reine Noxe - 2018-02-04 at 3:17 AM

While our hero was procastrinating struggling to come to the place of danger, the guards at the gate of the palace were instructed to close the gate again and the visitors were invited inside


ThatDude Les Bakk - 2018-02-04 at 6:55 PM

What's that? Is that.. is that Bakk's pet dragon Rupert?


Les Oliveas - 2018-02-04 at 6:58 PM

A sour wind tears through the kingdom.


La reine Noxe - 2018-02-04 at 7:13 PM

The queen turns towards her son: "Bakk! What did I tell you about keeping pet dragons?" - she asks.


ThatDude Les Bakk - 2018-02-04 at 7:46 PM

But muuum! - he replies


Les Oliveas - 2018-02-04 at 8:12 PM

"No ifs, no buts, no dragons" she says sternly.


Le Electrux - 2018-02-04 at 8:15 PM

Bakk looks gloomy. He replies sincerely: "Mum, why don't u let me keep a dragon for a pet? It's not harming anyone. And look! It is so cute!!!"


romangraef89o - 2018-02-04 at 8:16 PM

"Uff. why cant you have a normal pet like any other kid. Doesn't a toad suffice?"


Les Oliveas - 2018-02-04 at 8:18 PM

"Toads are ew", he says


ThatDude Les Bakk - 2018-02-04 at 8:19 PM

Rupert crushes the local bread shop with his foot


Julien - 2018-02-04 at 8:22 PM

The King awakes from his deep sleep and sees a dragon outside


Les Oliveas - 2018-02-04 at 8:24 PM

He hears chaos on the streets below, as the locals scramble for safety amid the settling dust of what once resembled a building.


Le Electrux - 2018-02-04 at 9:57 PM

he goes dumbfounded. Calling his guards, he demands answers from them as to what is going on outside. The guards hastily reply - "Dragon! Bakk! Aarrggghhh It's here!!!!!!!"


EvilArcher - 2018-02-04 at 10:13 PM

Queen Nox appears in the door, as she approaches her husband, he asks what is going on with their son


romangraef89o - 2018-02-05 at 12:16 AM

"he is just having his usual :v:thing:v:. this time it is a dragon. we really have to talk him. he is so damn stubborn"


ThatDude Les Bakk - 2018-02-05 at 12:28 AM

RUPERT NOT THERE! HAHAHHA


La reine Noxe - 2018-02-05 at 12:31 AM

Rupert proceeds to sit on a fountain, but it crushes under his weight and suddenly water is shooting in every direction.


Julien - 2018-02-05 at 12:42 AM

The king order his son: "Take this dragon out of my sight !"


romangraef89o - 2018-02-05 at 12:49 AM

"But dad." he said to be interrupted by the kind again


EvilArcher - 2018-02-05 at 12:52 AM

"ENOUGH SON!" the king shouted


ThatDude Les Bakk - 2018-02-05 at 2:57 AM

ok dad.....


La reine Noxe - 2018-02-05 at 3:41 AM

"You know that you'll have to pay for whatever the dragon destroys, Bakk, from your pocket money" - said the queen


EvilArcher - 2018-02-05 at 3:46 AM

"Yeah mom, I get it :frowning: :cry: "


Curse-Kun - 2018-02-05 at 1:00 PM

Nobody knew that the dragon is pregnant.  :dragon_face:
